# Adventure-game

In this project, you'll see a simpler version of an old-fashioned text-based adventure game.
## what is it?
This is only a very short game with a couple of choices available to the player.
- The game gives players a description of what's happening, and then asks them to make a choice.
- Something different happens depending on the choice the player made.
- The game also includes some random factors, so that it's a little different each time.
